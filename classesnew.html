        <p>1- Discrete Mathematics</p>
        <p  >Expectations with this Subject:-</p> 
        <p style="color: rgb(70, 5, 5);"> Discrete mathematics is the mathematical language of computer science. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in all branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, programming languages, cryptography, automated theorem proving, and software development. Conversely, computer implementations are tremendously significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world applications, such as in operations research.</p>

        <p>2- Computer Organization and Architecture</p>
        <p >Expectations with this Subject:-</p> 
        <p style="color: rgb(70, 5, 5);">The subject explores how machines are designed, built, and operate.
            Knowing what's inside and how it works will help in design, develop, and implement applications better, faster, cheaper, more efficient, and easier to use because we will be able to make informed decisions instead of guestimating and assuming.</p>

        <p>3- Data Structure </p>
        <p >Expectations with this Subject:-</p> 
        <p style="color: rgb(70, 5, 5);">Computer science is all about storing and computing from a given data. So studying data structures helps in dealing with different ways of arranging, processing and storing data.All codes are made for real time purpose so data structure allow user to provide/use/handle date in different ways.</p>

        <p>4- Buisness Communication</p>
        <p >Expectations with this Subject:-</p> 
        <p style="color: rgb(70, 5, 5);">Its main purpose is to improve organiztional practices,eliminates silos,keeps employees informed and reduce errors.Effective Buisness Communication is essential for success and growth of every Organization.Unlike everyday communication Buisness communication is goal oriented.  </p>

        <p>5- Operating System</p>
        <p >Expectations with this Subject:-</p> 
        <p style="color: rgb(70, 5, 5);">Operating system is an interface between the user and the computer hardware. It controls the execution of application software and manages the computer hardware.There are multiple reasons to behind the study of operating system . Some of them are given below :
            <br>  To use operating system daily. Operating system are everywhere.
            <br> To learn about system design so that we can extend the features of operating system.
            <br> To solve any problem occurring in operating system.
            <br> To learn how to manage the computer resources appropriately.  </p>

        <p>6- C language</p>
        <p >Expectations with this Subject:-</p> 
        <p style="color: rgb(70, 5, 5);">Learning C programming has lot of benefits, but the foremost thing in which it helps is to understand the underlying architecture of how things works?. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write operating system.</p>

        <p>1- Web development</p>
        <p >Expectations with this Subject:-</p> 
        <p style="color: rgb(70, 5, 5);">Web development gives the opportunity to express ourself creatively on the internet. If we have an idea we would like to try as  discover your web dev skills, try it out. Web dev is a fun, creative experience.</p>

        <p>2- C Lab</p>
        <p >Expectations with this Subject:-</p> 
        <p style="color: rgb(70, 5, 5);">It’s flexible; I can do whatever I want to do. There is no restriction even I can access restricted memory locations too using pointers. Since C language lacks some safety features but this makes C language more flexible as you can access anything from anywhere.
            It’s really easy and short: using few library functions and data types, I can design functions for any kind of problems</p>
